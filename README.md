# Assembly Projects

This repository contains various assembly language projects for ARMv7 and Intel x86 architectures.

## Projects

1. **Factorial Calculator (ARMv7)**
    - A program that calculates the factorial of a number up to 10. The limit can be changed as needed.

2. **8-Segment Display Controller (ARMv7)**
    - A controller for an 8-segment display that supports both polling and interrupt modes. It includes push buttons and uses the 'w' and 's' keys to increment or decrement the displayed value.

3. **Digit Adder (Intel x86 and C)**
    - A project that combines Intel x86 assembly and C programming to add digits. This demonstrates interoperability between assembly language and high-level programming languages.
